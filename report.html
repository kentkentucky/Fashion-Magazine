    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <h3>
      What is the essential story being told by your website and what type of
      structure did you choose to implement?
    </h3>
    <p>
      My website is a fashion newsletter designed for fashion enthusiasts who
      crave the latest trends, news, and updates in the world of fashion. It's a
      digital fashion hub where visitors can immerse themselves in a daily dose
      of style inspiration, from footwear and brands to watches, celebrity
      fashion, and new releases. To create an engaging and immersive experience,
      I've opted for a sleek, minimalistic, and edgy design with a darker theme.
      The clean and cool look of the website reflects the modern fashion scene
      and the tastes of fashion-forward individuals. In terms of structure, I've
      chosen a hierarchical layout to enhance navigation. The homepage serves as
      the gateway to the latest and most popular articles, ensuring visitors
      stay up-to-date with the freshest fashion content. Additionally, I've
      organized the website into distinct categories, such as videos, releases,
      and the latest trends, making it effortless for users to explore content
      that interests them.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Inspiration:</h2>
    <h3>
      State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website(e.g.
      guest speakers, websites, artists, blogs)
    </h3>
    <p>
      Three prominent sources of inspiration for my website design are
      Hypebeast, GQ, and Vogue. Hypebeast is a website that holds a special
      place in my heart, as I used to be an avid reader. The color palette,
      primarily dark and neutral tones, immediately captivated me. It perfectly
      complements the streetwear and fashion aesthetics I aim to embody. The
      seamless navigation through various categories and sub-categories greatly
      enhances user experience. The organized layout and clean aesthetic create
      a user-friendly environment. Moreover, the curated articles on the latest
      drops and releases always draw me back, showcasing the power of
      well-curated content. GQ and Vogue are renowned fashion platforms that
      have also significantly influenced my design choices. GQ's sophisticated
      yet approachable layout and Vogue's timeless elegance have both played a
      role in shaping my website's aesthetics. I admire how they seamlessly
      blend high-quality visuals with informative content, creating a visually
      stunning and informative experience for readers.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Accessibility:</h2>
    <h3>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible</h3>
    <p>
      1) I have made my website accessible is by ensuring images have alt text.
    </p>
    <p>2) I have added aria labels to buttons</p>
    <p>3) Videos have captions</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Learning:</h2>
    <h3>
      State 3 things you had to learn or find out to create your site. How did
      you achieve that?
    </h3>
    <p>
      To create my website, I had to learn and implement several key elements. I
      needed to incorporate a carousel to display related images about an
      article on my website. This involves understanding HTML, CSS, JavaScript
      to create a responsive and interactive carousel. I achieved this by
      watching Youtube tutorials which provided step-by-step guidances that help
      me grasp the concept.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to use Handlebars.js to dynamically generate my HTML content on
      my website as it is flexible. As newsletter needs to be updated
      frequently, making my website modular would help in the future. Learning
      Handlebars.js involved exploring its documentation and experimenting
      syntax. Online forums were very useful for troubleshooting and finding
      solutions to the challenges i faced.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also had to learn how to create a navigation menu that pops out when you
      click the hamburger icon. By referring to resources online, i learned how
      to add interactivity to event listeners. I achieve this by changing the
      css properties and adding transitions once the click on the icon is
      detected. To make the menu work well for both small and large screen
      sizes, i had to learn about responsive design and experiment with the css
      style on small screen sizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In summary, my learning process involved a combination of online
      resources, including Google searches, YouTube tutorials, documentation,
      and community forums. By taking a structured approach to learning and
      seeking help when needed, I was able to acquire the skills and knowledge
      necessary to create my website effectively.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Evaluation I</h2>
    <h3>
      What aspects of your work do you think were particularly successful? Why?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The carousel was one of the most challenging parts of my project which
      turns out to be my favourite. The time and effort that went into creating
      the carousel made it more satisfying. The carousel offers a visually
      engaging way to showcase content. I'm proud of how the arrow buttons
      seamlessly disappear when users reach both ends of the carousel, which
      also enhances the user experience by preventing unnecessary clicks. The
      inclusion of dots to indicate current slide and quick navigation also adds
      a layer of interactivity that i find satisfying.
    </p>
    <p>
      The layout of the website aligns perfectly with the dark and clean
      aesthetoc I was aiming for. It effectively conveys the intended mood and
      style. The overall design layout enhances content presentation and
      readability, contributing to a positive user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The footer design is one of my favourites. When users hover over it, the
      footer slides to the right, providing a subtle yet visually pleasing
      interaction. The social handles also changes colour when hovering over
      which adds a touch of interactivity and engagement, making the footer not
      just functional but aesthetically pleasing.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Evaluation II:</h2>
    <h3>
      What aspects of your work could be improved? How might you do things
      differently another time?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I feel that making the entire website more modular is really important,
      especially for a newsletter that requires daily updates. Using
      Handlebars.js would really streamline the process of adding and updating
      content. Next time, I would start by building a modular template using
      Handlebars.js, separating the structure from the content. This would allow
      anyone to easily upload and update articles and images.
    </p>
    <p>
      While i aimed for a responsive design, I noticed that certain elements
      didn't adapt well to different screen sizes. Some elements appeared out of
      place while transitioning. To address this, I would avoid using absolute
      or fixed positioning and instead use relative units like maximum and
      minimum width/height which I hope would ensure that the layout remain
      consistent across the various screen sizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recognise that there is room for improvement in the forms and checkout
      process. Enhancing user feedback during the checkout process and
      implementing validation checks for correct input would lead to a smoother
      user experience. In future projects, I plan to invest time in learning how
      to code and implement these features effectively yo create a more
      user-friendly and error-free checkout process.
